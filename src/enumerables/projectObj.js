      "Upside Business Travel was an online travel agency (OTA) and online booking tool (OBT) with a website and mobile app. At Upside, our team designed for the business traveler - conducting user research, collecting first-hand insights, and delivering new features monthly in tandem with customer feedback.\n\nMy team was responsible for resolving the problem of one way rental cars, critical to unlocking revenue from travelers who needed to go from Point A to B to C, rather than A to B to A. In addition to this work, I led the refactoring of our booking engine and incorporated multiple third-party travel APIs in partnership with key stakeholders in our vendor partner organizations. Across the organization, 80% of code was shipped to production in 72 hours. \n\nIn addition to these responsibilities, I was an active member of our company's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts in partnership with our leadership team. We focused on the company's quarterly and annual OKRs, with measurable progress made on our team diversity metrics from 2019 to 2021. I also spearheaded multiple discussion sessions with experts and our team, resulting in a revamped company mission statement and the mention of DE&I as a positive impact on multiple employee NPS surveys.",
